EX43 Bonus

Now that we've covered the Reflection API briefly, time to apply it!

Write a function 

	void display(Object);

It should be able to take any object and print its class name, all of its 
annotations, constructors, methods, and fields.
Check out the difference between getMethods() and getDeclaredMethods()
(and the same for fields, etc).

Ex43Bonus.java is a template that will show it handling a String, an int, an Enum, and a Record.
